## Hobby

### JnaanBot

[JnaanBot](http://t.me/djsanghbot) is a [Telegram App Bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots). It can configured to send notifications to an individual or a group, and can also be used to answer questions.

It's used by [DJ Sangh](http://djsangh.org/) telegram app group for querying details, and getting notifications on events like Thirthankara Kalyanakas, Astami, Chathurdashi and so on.
